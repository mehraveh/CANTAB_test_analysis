"presentation number : Each presentation consists of the display of a flashing cross, which the subject must touch before the timeout is reached. The presentations in this test are numbered from 1. "
"invigilator advance preceded : Blank unless this problem was preceded by a 'please wait' screen awaiting a key press by the invigilator. (In this case the duration of that screen is given). "
"assessed : Whether this was an assessed problem (versus a practice one). "
"timeout : Time permitted for the subject to respond. "
"stimulus x : Horizontal location of the stimulus from the left of the screen, on a scale from 0-1600. "
"stimulus y : Vertical location of the stimulus from the top of the screen, on a scale from 0-1200. "
"hit latency : The time taken to make a sufficiently accurate touch, or 'miss' if none was made. "
"touch number : Touches made during this presentation (whether accurate or not), numbered from 1. "
"touch latency : The time of this touch measured from the first appearance of the stimulus. "
"touch x : Horizontal location of the touch from the left of the screen, on a scale from 0-1600. "
"touch y : Vertical location of the touch from the top of the screen, on a scale from 0-1200. "
"distance : Distance of the touch from the centre of the stimulus. "
"hit : Whether this press was sufficiently accurate to be deemed a 'hit' and cause the test to move on to the next one. "
